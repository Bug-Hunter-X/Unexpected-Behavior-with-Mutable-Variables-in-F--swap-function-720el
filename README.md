This example demonstrates a common misconception when using mutable variables in F#.  The `swap` function appears to swap the values of `x` and `y`, but it doesn't affect the original variables passed in. This is because F# passes values by value, and only creates a local copy inside the function. The solution explains how to properly swap mutable variables using techniques like passing in references or returning a tuple.
